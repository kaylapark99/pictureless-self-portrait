A digital art piece focusing on how one's metadata is available and out for the world to see. I recorded all of my digital communications' metadata for 24 hours to attempt to see how much you can learn about me. It is scary how much you can learn about someone from their metadata. (Still in progress. Adding more little details and responsive design)
